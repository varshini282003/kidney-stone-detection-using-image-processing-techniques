# kidney-stone-detection-using-image-processing-techniques
This project develops an automated system for detecting kidney stones using image processing. It converts images to grayscale, applies binary thresholding, and uses morphological operations to isolate stones. Enhanced contrast and filtering highlight features, while connected component labeling counts the stones.
